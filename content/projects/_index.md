# Project ideas

What are other project ideas you might want to develop?

Think about applications or web sites you use every day.
Can you create something similar, even if it's going to be simpler?

Here are several ideas.

**Pizzeria Ordering System**:
Using Python, Flask, and SQLite, develop a web application that allows customers to place pizza orders.
The order would include options like crust type (thin, thick, or stuffed), size, sauce (tomato, barbecue, or pesto),
cheese (mozzarella, cheddar, or feta), and toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, etc.).
The order can then be printed for the kitchen staff to prepare the pizza.

**Ice Cream Parlor**:
Create an application to serve an ice cream parlor, where customers can select their ice cream base
(vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, etc.), the number of scoops, type of cone (waffle, sugar, or cake),
and additional toppings (sprinkles, nuts, fruits, etc.).
Orders will be recorded in the SQLite database and printed for staff to assemble the ice cream.

**Sandwich Shop**:
Design a web application that allows customers to customize their sandwiches.
The order would include options like bread type (white, whole grain, or ciabatta), protein (turkey, ham, or veggie),
cheese (swiss, provolone, or cheddar), condiments (mayo, mustard, or hummus), and toppings (lettuce, tomato, onion, etc.).
The orders will be stored in the SQLite database and printed for the kitchen staff.

**Movie Theater Snack Bar**:
Create a web application that serves a movie theater snack bar. Customers can select their movie showtime and seats,
then choose from various snacks like popcorn (small, medium, large), soft drinks (Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta), and candies (chocolate, gummies, etc.).
The orders will be stored in the SQLite database and printed for the snack bar staff to prepare.

**Bookstore Management System**:
Develop a web application to manage a small bookstore. Customers can search for books based on the title, author, or genre,
and add them to their shopping cart. The system should track inventory levels and process orders.
Book information, customer details, and orders can be stored in the SQLite database.
